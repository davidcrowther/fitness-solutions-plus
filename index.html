            <h4>Pretty soon after I started personal training, I realized that exercise <br /> alone isn’t enough to change your <br /> body.</h4>
            <p>Unfortunately most personal trainers aren’t trained in nutrition and supplementation.</p>   
            <p><strong>Fat loss resistance</strong> is very real. In some people, there are certain “physiological blockages” that make fat loss more difficult and frustrating than it should be.</p> 
            <p>And unless you know what to look for, you don’t know what to fix.</p> 
            <p>My <strong>Dream Body Map</strong> program removes these blockages through the right fitness, nutrition and supplementation.</p>

              <cite>“I have worked with many personal trainers in the past and I have found that they just make it up as they go along and put me through a ‘cookie cutter’ program instead of developing something just for me! When I first met with him he really took the time to listen to what I wanted to accomplish and performed assessments so that he could tailor the program to my needs! I finally enjoy going to the gym!” </cite>

            <dt><span class="blue">Q.</span> Why have my previous exercise programs not worked?</dt>
            <dd>Most programs are not tailor-made for your unique body; they are commonly cookie-cutter solutions that never work for everybody. How can a 35-year-old woman who wants to lose weight hope to get results from the same program that a 65-year-old man uses to improve his golf score? Other programs often have an over-reliance on training at the expense of nutrition or quality rest too.</dd>
            <dt><span class="blue">Q.</span> What’s the main key to getting results?</dt>
            <dd>Personalizing a fitness program around your own body and your own goals; and then maintaining the consistency that comes from enjoying what you are doing and seeing the great results.</dd>
